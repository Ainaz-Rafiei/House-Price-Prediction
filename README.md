# Decision Tree Model - Jupyter Notebook

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook (`DT.ipynb`) that implements a Decision Tree model for classification or regression tasks. The notebook includes data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and visualization.

## Contents
- **Data Loading & Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and splitting data.
- **Model Training**: Implementing a Decision Tree model using scikit-learn.
- **Evaluation**: Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
- **Visualization**: Decision tree plot to interpret model decisions.

## Requirements
To run the notebook, install the following dependencies:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```
## Usage
Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd <repo-folder>
```

Open Jupyter Notebook:
```bash
jupyter notebook DT.ipynb
```
Run the cells step by step to train and evaluate the Decision Tree model.
